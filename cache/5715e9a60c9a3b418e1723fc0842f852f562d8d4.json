Actual\npeople, with concrete visions, working for a long time, made them happen. That hotel, that park, that\nrailway. The world is a museum of passion projects.\n\nThis basic wonder is what animates us at Stripe. Things around us could be so much richer\u2014in every\nsense of that word\u2014than they are. The dedication of doers is what makes the world a continually\nimproving place, and we\u2019re keen to play a small role in helping make that happen.\n\nWe enormously appreciate the trust of the millions of businesses that rely on Stripe. As Stripe grows, we\nwant to make sure that anyone interested has a chance to hear what we\u2019re up to.\n\nCollectively, businesses built on Stripe processed more than $817 billion in total volume in 2022, up 26%\nfrom the prior year. (Ecommerce, an imperfect but relevant comparison, grew 7% last year.) This is a\nsignificant deceleration from the breakneck growth that we saw during 2020 and 2021. At the same time,\nwe are as confident as ever in the internet economy\u2019s long-term prospects, and we\u2019re heartened by the\nsteady advancement of the millions of businesses we serve in the face of banking crises, war, pestilence,\nenergy shocks, supply chain issues, inflation, and broader volatility.\n\nMore than 100 companies now handle more than $1 billion in payments with Stripe every year. This set\ncontinues to grow rapidly, expanding by more than 50% each year since 2018. Some of this expansion is\nabout established titans, but most isn\u2019t. Part of the joy of working at Stripe is partnering with early startups\non their way to meteoric success. Of these 100+ category leaders, more than half have grown their\nrevenue 10x while on Stripe, and over a quarter have grown 100x. Many now-household names, such as\nInstacart, Substack, and DoorDash (originally known as \u201cPalo Alto Delivery\u201d) charged their customers with\nus from the very beginning.\n\nIn total, the number of new businesses coming to Stripe increased by 19% in 2022, with an average of\nmore than 1,000 new ventures launched every day. While the US is currently our largest market, 55% of the\nbusinesses that joined Stripe last year were based outside of the US. Stripe now supports businesses in\nmore than 50 countries.\n\nOur first operating principle is \u201cUsers First.\u201d Part of the value of serving smart customers is that just\nlistening to suggestions is a surprisingly effective product strategy. Last year, substantially informed by\nuser feedback, we shipped 244 new user-facing features and 336 API updates. We\u2019re always eager to hear\nmore about what would help you\u2014get in touch via Twitter or founders@stripe.com.\n"}, {"metadata": {"source": "uploads\\stripe-2022-update.pdf", "file_path": "uploads\\stripe-2022-update.pdf", "page": 1, "total_pages": 10, "CreationDate": "D:20230405082624-06'00'", "Creator": "Acrobat Pro 23.1.20093", "ModDate": "D:20230405082624-06'00'", "Producer": "Acrobat Pro 23.1.20093", "Title": ""}, "page_content": "Our mission is to grow the GDP of the internet.

We don\u2019t fully\nunderstand why (and would be keen to read further research on this question), but various data sources\ndepict a consistent picture. According to the US Census, the rate of business formation has increased by\n44% since 2019. Delaware, similarly, saw 24% more incorporations in 2022 than in 2019. Y Combinator\nreported a record number of applicants for their most recent batch. These data points match what we see:\nStripe Atlas, our service for helping startups get off the ground, saw a remarkable 155% more new\ncompanies started in 2022 than in 2019.\n\nWe\u2019re excited by this trend and think everyone else should be too. Entrepreneurship is the lifeblood of a\ndynamic economy. For all the gloomy economic headlines, it\u2019s important to contextualize with the fact that\nmore new ventures are being started today than during the market boom of 2021.\n\nIn response to this, we\u2019ve shipped lots of improvements to Atlas. Last year, we added company name\nsearch, a visual cap table, inline document signing, more accurate ETAs, faster EIN issuance, pre-filled\n83(b) forms, and significant credits packages that help seed capital stretch further.\n\nDespite the encouraging startup formation trends, the environment is also, in many respects, getting\nharder. After a decade-long bull run, venture capital invested in startups declined by two-thirds in Q4\n2022 compared to Q1 2021. While the market may have overcorrected, a correction was in order: in\ndescribing financing conditions in 2021, few would reach for \u201chealthy\u201d as their first adjective.\n\nAs a consequence of tightening conditions, we are seeing startups monetize earlier and in more ways.\nWe\u2019re working hard to make this easier and faster across the board.\n\nThe most basic way is to reduce the time to a business\u2019s first revenue dollar.

Over the past year, we launched\nautomated SaaS pricing tables (supporting models including flat-rate, per-seat, and tiered pricing),\nupgraded Stripe Billing\u2019s customer portal (to allow customers to self-manage payment details, invoices,\nand subscriptions), and improved our revenue recovery tools (to retain revenue that would otherwise be\nlost to involuntary churn).\n\nThis represents an important product strategy shift for Stripe. In the beginning, we strictly focused on\neasy-to-use payments APIs. Now, we\u2019re seeing that we can accelerate product development for startups\nby providing scaffolding and hosted UIs for managing revenue. Our goal is to eliminate all the duplicative\nhassle that comes with scaling revenue for an early-stage company. It's lunacy for every company to\nreimplement the same flows.\nThe AI revolution\n\nA new alien technology has landed, and it goes by the name of the \u201clarge language model.\u201d Progress is\nrapid, and, in recent weeks, we\u2019ve seen the launch of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4, Midjourney v5, Google Bard,\nAnthropic\u2019s API, Canva\u2019s new creative tools, and many more releases besides.\nSteampunk payment cards,\u2028\ncourtesy of Midjourney v5\nThese language models will act as Heelys for cognitive tasks.

For example, when OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November, it took them five days to\nreach one million users, making it perhaps the fastest-adopted consumer tech product ever. (It took\nFacebook 10 months to hit that milestone.) For its flagship products, ChatGPT Plus and DALL\u00b7E, OpenAI\nuses Stripe to accept payments (offering dozens of payment method choices for global customers),\nmanage subscriptions, offer one-click checkout, calculate sales taxes, recognize revenue, fight fraud, and\nmore. Stripe enables them to scale their revenue far faster and more efficiently than would otherwise be\npossible.\nInternally, it\u2019s clear that ML and AI advances will continue to improve the quality of our products and to\nmake them even easier to use. Alongside GPT-4\u2019s launch, we launched GPT-4-powered Stripe Docs. Every\nuser can soon benefit from an AI research assistant who has devoured the whole Stripe documentation\nand is available 24x7 to developers designing their integrations. We have also seen significantly improved\nfraud detection performance thanks to transformer-based models that can better handle Stripe\u2019s scale\nand breadth of data.\n\nPart of what we enjoy about the tech industry is our collective excitability.

Some of this will no doubt happen with AI, but we\ndo believe that the capabilities of LLMs and transformers will prove fundamental and enduring.\nKnowledge workers will become more productive.

We decided to look at\nour data on \u201cbreakout startups\u201d: that is, new companies with unusually rapid revenue ramps. As a proxy,\nthis isn\u2019t perfect: some breakout companies come out of the gate more slowly, and some companies\nwith rapid revenue ramps aren\u2019t truly breakout startups.

Though we deliberately avoid describing the mechanics in any detail, we\u2019re committed\nto being a leader in this space.\n\nLastly, we design reliability into our financial operations. Stripe\u2019s funds are held with systemically\nimportant financial institutions (SIFI). We are continually monitoring the world\u2019s financial partners and\nissuers. When even a single issuer is experiencing problems (such as server downtime), automated\nalerting enables our operations team to take immediate actions to minimize any customer disruption.\nWhat comes next\nAs we said at the beginning, the present world is anything but dull. While 2019 feels like a different era, it\u2019s\nentirely plausible that the changes of the next four years will be greater than those that just ensued. We\u2019ll\nall need our wits about us.\n\nWe\u2019re fundamentally optimistic about what is to come. The internet remains one of the most potent\nenablers of opportunity and advancement in the history of humanity. Several billion people recently\nimmigrated to earth\u2019s most vibrant city. The world should be more prosperous than it is, and, thanks to the\nnew possibilities afforded by software and better connectivity, virtually every facet of our existence can be\nmeaningfully enriched.\n\nIt seems to us a certainty that greater rates of change\u2014often a clich\u00e9, but now an emphatic truth\u2014will\nincrease the returns to agility in every pursuit. The business model flexibility and execution speed that\nStripe enables have yielded dividends for the world\u2019s most ambitious organizations. Our hope is that these\ncapabilities can increasingly benefit businesses of all sizes and flavors. By helping companies avoid being\nhemmed in by their existing infrastructure, we hope that they can focus more on inventing new products\nand doubling down on what actually makes them special.\n\nIf the topics covered in this letter are your cup of tea, we would love to host you at Stripe Sessions, our in-\nperson annual conference, on Wednesday, May 3, at Pier 48 in San Francisco. You\u2019ll hear from other\nfounders and industry experts on how they\u2019re adapting, and we\u2019ll share Stripe\u2019s in-flight product work.\n(And if you can\u2019t join us in person, you can watch the keynote online.)
